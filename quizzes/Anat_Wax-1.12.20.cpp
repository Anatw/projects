/*******************************************************************************
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at
index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original
array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would
be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output
would be [2, 3, 6].

thereâ€™s naive approach o(n^2) and a better approach o(n)
start with the first, continue to the second
(what if you can't use division?)
